Thanks for your time',

            answer: 'Now it\'s a bit strange; usually, if the export process encounters an error, an explicit message will be displayed. In this case, if the download process is already running but no files are downloaded, it could be that your mobile browser is blocking the automatic download due to some advance security settings. All mobile devices I have tested so far do not exhibit the same issue. I will try to investigate this further, but chances are I won\'t be able to resolve it if I cannot reproduce the issue.

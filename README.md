## YGO Carder

* Template provided by: [Grezar](https://www.deviantart.com/grezar) and [9558able](https://www.deviantart.com/9558able)
* GUI by me, a.k.a @lauqerm

### Thank you

My utmost appreciation to [Grezar](https://www.deviantart.com/grezar) and [9558able](https://www.deviantart.com/9558able), for allowing me to use their templates. They are the reason this project is possible in the first place.

### My goal

Create an easy-to-use GUI to make Yu-gi-oh cards, for anyone who cannot afford Photoshop or the skill needed to use it.

### What does it provide?

To put it more correctly: what advantage does my app offer over a dozen Yu-gi-oh card-maker apps out there? For short, it is just 2 things:
* The UI - Most of changes can be made with just a single click or keystroke. Other apps will need you to constantly cycle through multiple dropdowns.
* Automatic text compression - You may notice modern Yu-gi-oh cards try to compress words to avoid using smaller font sizes. YGO Carder can replicate that behavior while other apps will just simply keep reducing font size and adding new lines.

Other advantages such as foils and additional card frames come from the template of use, so again big shout out to template owners who put their time and effort into creating them.

### What does it NOT provide?

The app of course has multiple shortcomings, many of them are by design, while others may become future plans:
* No template for Rush Duel - Template for Rush Duel is already available, so maybe I will revisit this idea in the future.
* No ultra card size - While some apps may offer 4K resolution for their card, this app does not. While I think the current card resolution of my app is decently enough, you can always seek for professional up-scale method.
* No remote saving - This app does not have a dedicated server for such feature, but thanks to that I can serve the app for a long time completely free without ads or the need for any finacial support. The app only provides very simple card information export and import, and your card art should come from online links.

### Can I use your source code in my site?

Yes, you are free to fork it and do whatever, just don't claim it is yours. Also, I will be extra thankful if you keep the credit for me and template makers.

If you want to modify app's assets, better contact template makers and ask for permission yourself.

You may contact me through [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/lauqerm/), but I rarely respond in time though, I only visit reddit once in a while.
